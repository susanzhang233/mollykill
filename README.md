### Abstract

This project is aimed to building a model that would aid drug design processes. The project is expected to learn graphical features of the molecules that are believed to have inhibition effect for the specific protein SARS coronavirus 3C-like Protease (3CLPro) . Then, the model would develop a reasonable way to generate potential novel molecules inhibitors' graphically representations. After that, with a defeaturizer, the graphical representations would be converted into actual molecule plots. 

### Dataset
The [dataset](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/1706) for training is obtained from pubchem, which contains a through screening for inhibitors of the protease.

### Limitations(Future work)
- Currently, some generated molecules might not be viable. Therefore, some conditions for the generation might be added.
- The dimension of the discriminator might be improved by adding more features of the molecules(ie. hybridization, stereochemistry, etc)
